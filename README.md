Capstone project #2 for Springboard Data Science Career Track, by Leo Evancie

This is the second of three capstone projects in the course, and the first
project created completely from scratch. Further context may be found in
the proposal. The 'notebooks' folder contains annotated code in
Jupyter notebooks.

Please note:
This project is still under development, with this repository allowing me to
submit checkpoints to the course administrators.
